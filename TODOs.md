# TODOs:

* [ ] Support for CcSharedInfo (dynamic dependencies from vanilla `rules_cc`)
* [ ] Use [bazel-starlib](https://github.com/cgrindel/bazel-starlib) to have `tidy` (and friends) utilities
* [ ] Add tests package (with actual tests)
* [ ] Try out the zig CC toolchain
* [ ] Allow development rules (like `stardoc`) to be run remotely
